          Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean
          user interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’
          little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making
          a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an
          impressive site is to master the art of front-end development, and no,
          it is not as easy as it seems!

          <br /><br />

          However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help
          you get better in front-end design and web development
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="list-item">Commenting</li>
          <p>
            Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
            programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
            programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
            project you create. With proper comments and organised files its
            always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
            things are at and how they work.
          </p>
          <li class="list-item">Invest in productive Tools</li>
          <p>
            The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from
            browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available
            now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web
            tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills?
            Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass
            are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.
          </p>
          <li class="list-item">Always be curious</li>
          <p>
            A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated
            continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. You
            need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end
            development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of
            the most informative and useful learning sources for front-end
            developers -
          </p>

          <ul id="ul-list">
            <li><a href="">Frontend Focus</a></li>
            <li><a href="">CSS Weekly</a></li>
            <li><a href="">JavaScript Weekly</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Web Design Weekly</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Codrops</a></li>
            <li><a href="">ShopTalk Podcast</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These
            meet-ups provide excellent opportunities to expand your network and
            get acquainted with talented people.
          </p>

          <li class="list-item">Refactor your code time to time</li>
          <p>
            By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without
            tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and
            readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your
            code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version
            of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant
            advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code
            remains free from plagiarism.
          </p>
          <li class="list-item">Automate!</li>
          <p>
            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute
            little details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to
            invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow,
            dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment,
            and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right? <br />
            Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your
            workflow. While automation can take care of things such as
            optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
            front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side
            software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not
            only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use
            your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall
            functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
            efficient automation tools.
          </p>
        </ol>
        <p>
          While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end
          designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while
          designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to
          create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in
          making it big in front-end development.
